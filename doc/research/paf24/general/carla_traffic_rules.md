## Introduction

CARLA (Car Learning to Act) is an open-source simulator for testing and developing autonomous driving systems. It integrates traffic rules to create a flexible environment, letting users adjust regulations and design custom maps to evaluate driving behaviors without following specific national laws.

## Key Traffic Principles and Complex Interactions

- **Traffic Signals**: Vehicles must stop at red lights and go on green.

- **Stop Signs**: Vehicles must stop at stop signs and yield to pedestrians
  and other cars.

- **Lane Management**: Cars should remain in their designated lanes.

- **Speed Limits**: Different speed limits in various areas of the map allow
  testing of speed control and adherence to traffic laws.

- **Pedestrian Rights**: Vehicles must yield to pedestrians at crosswalks,
  which is vital for pedestrian detection and ensuring safe stops.

- **Intersection Management**: Vehicles must navigate intersections
  effectively, managing stop lights and stop signs while yielding when
  necessary to keep traffic moving.
  *Note: According to the [CARLA documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_traffic_manager/) the Traffic Manager uses its own priority system at junctions. This is a known problem in the simulation.*

- **Roundabout Navigation**: Vehicles should yield to cars already in the
  roundabout. This tests their ability to navigate circular roads and merge
  correctly.

- **Crosswalk Behavior**: Vehicles need to detect and stop for pedestrians
  at crosswalks, highlighting the importance of pedestrian safety.

- **Bicycle Lane Navigation**: Vehicles should be able to detect and safely
  navigate around cyclists in traffic.

- **Parking Maneuvers**: Vehicles are tested on their ability to park in
  tight spaces, simulating real-life parking challenges.

## CARLA Maps and Their Traffic Scenarios

CARLA has 12 maps, each designed to test different aspects of self-driving,
from basic navigation to complex urban and rural situations.
Users can also create custom maps, allowing for additional testing scenarios
tailored to specific needs.

### Overview of CARLA Maps

- **Town 1**: A small town with T-junctions and bridges, focusing on managing
  intersections and staying in lanes.

- **Town 2**: Similar to Town 1, this town includes shops and homes, testing
  navigation and awareness of the surroundings.

- **Town 3**: A larger city area with roundabouts and underpasses, assessing
  navigation in roundabouts and speed adjustments.

- **Town 4**: A small town with a figure-eight road, testing navigation in
  multiple lanes and interactions with pedestrians.

- **Town 5**: An urban area with multilane roads and a highway, focusing on
  highway driving and commercial strategies.

- **Town 6**: A less populated town with unique junctions, testing navigation
  in multiple lanes and the use of slip roads.

- **Town 7**: A rural community with no marked roads, which tests navigation
  and parking in residential areas.

- **Town 8 & Town 9**: Hidden maps used for the Leaderboard challenge.

- **Town 10**: An inner-city area with various junctions and pedestrian
  activity, testing skills in complex traffic situations.

- **Town 11**: A basic map for testing navigation in open areas with fewer
  visual guides.

- **Town 12**: A large map based on Amarillo, Texas, featuring urban,
  residential, and rural areas to test navigation and visual skills across
  diverse environments.

### Rural and Highway Scenarios

Maps like **Town 7** and **Town 12** focus on rural and highway driving,
simulating open and high-speed areas. They test long-distance driving,
speed management, and safe overtaking, requiring drivers to adapt to
unmarked roads and agricultural settings.

## Road Network Creation with ASAM OpenDRIVE®

Road networks in CARLA are built using **ASAM OpenDRIVE®**, which standardizes
road descriptions:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Roads are organized into nodes for better
  integration.

- **Reference Line**: Each road has a reference line that defines its shape.

- **Interconnectivity**: Roads can connect to each other for realistic
  traffic flow.

## Units of Measurement

To keep tests consistent, CARLA uses standardized units:

- **Speed**: Measured in meters per second (m/s).

- **Distance**: Measured in meters.
